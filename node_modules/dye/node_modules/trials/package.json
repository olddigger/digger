The introduction above has an example of this.\n\nAn important thing to note with this function is that the values of the object **must sum to 1** for it to represent a proper mass function (and to guarantee a return value).\n\n### single(ary)\nTakes an Array and picks exactly one element from the array with uniform probability.\n\n```js\nfor (var i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) t.single(['hi', 'thar', 'miss']);\n```\n\nExample output:\n\n```bash\nhi\nmiss\nthar\nmiss\nthar\n```\n\n### multipleProbs(obj)\nTakes an object of individual probabilities, does one Bernoulli trial for each element of the object with the respective probabilities and collects all the keys of the successes.\n\n```js\nfor (var i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) {\n  t.multipleProbs({\n    a: 0.4,\n    b: 0.4,\n    c: 0.1\n  });\n}\n```\n\nExample output:\n\n```bash\n[ 'b' ]\n[ 'a', 'b' ]\n[ 'b' ]\n[]\n[ 'a', 'b' ]\n```\n\n### multiple(ary, p)\nTakes an array and a fixed probability, does one Bernoulli trial for each element in the array with the defined uniform probability, and collects all the successes.\n\n```js\nfor (var i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) t.multiple(['a', 'b', 'c'], 0.4);\n```\n\nExample output:\n\n```bash\n[ 'a' ]\n[ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]\n[]\n[ 'b', 'c' ]\n[ 'b' ]\n```\n\n### range(start, end)\nGets an integer in the range `start` to (and including) `end` with uniform probability.\nEquivalent to `single` on the array `[start, start+1, ... , end]`, but more efficient.\n\n### cluster(ary, max, p)\nCluster picks {1, 2, ..., max} elements uniformly from the array with probability `p`, or it picks none at all with probability `1-p`.\n\nThis is essentially a uniform distribution within a uniform distribution. It's uniform in that we either pick or don't pick with probability `p`, and if we pick, then how many we pick is uniformly distributed in the defined range. This creates the clusters, rather than true randomness.\n\n```js\nfor (var i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) t.cluster([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, 0.6);\n```\n\nExample output:\n\n```bash\n[ 2, 1 ]\n[ 4, 1, 5 ]\n[ 1 ]\n[]\n[ 3, 1, 4 ]\n[ 2 ]\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm install trials\n```\n\n## Running tests\nInstall development dependencies\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\nRun the tests\n\n```bash\n$ npm test\n```\n\n## License\nMIT-Licensed.
